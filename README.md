# WAZE - Churn Analysis and Model Building

Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely. 

Project is divided in 5 main sections, Inspecting and Analyzing the Data, Exploratory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Building a Logistic Regression Model, Building a Machine Learning Model using the ensemble techniques. This includes analysis of user data, extraction of insights, Machine Learning Model Building and selection and informed decision-making.
The project aims to boost user retention and app engagement by identifying and addressing monthly user churn
patterns within the Waze app.

The Project involves the use of a single dataset. The dataset contains 12 features and a little over 14000 row entries on seperate users . The features include:
* label - Binary target variable (“retained” vs “churned”) for if a user has churned anytime during the course of the month 

* sessions - The number of occurrence of a user opening the app during the month

* drives - An occurrence of driving at least 1 km during the month

* device - The type of device a user starts a session with

* total_sessions - A model estimate of the total number of sessions since a user has onboarded

* n_days_after_onboarding - The number of days since a user signed up for the app

* total_navigations_fav1 - Total navigations since onboarding to the user’s favorite place 1

* total_navigations_fav2 - Total navigations since onboarding to the user’s favorite place 2

* driven_km_drives - Total kilometers driven during the month

* duration_minutes_drives - Total duration driven in minutes during the month

* activity_days - Number of days the user opens the app during the month 

* driving_days - Number of days the user drives (at least 1 km) during the month
